As we don't have a full set of documentation implemented for Open Liberty yet, some of the items below point to the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/as_ditamaps/was900_welcome_liberty.html[official documentation for WebSphere Liberty] so you can find out more about them (WebSphere Liberty is built on Open Liberty).

[#sociallogin]
== Provide social media single sign-on options to app users (Social Login 1.0)

Social login is a form of web single sign-on using that uses existing user information from one social media providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Github, Linkedin) to sign a user into a website instead of creating a new login account specifically for the website. Logging in with a social media account is a fast and convenient way for users to log into your application or website hosted on a Liberty server. Users can select from a list of social media providers. You can customise this list according to the social media providers you offer or create your own selection form.

To enable Social Login 1.0, add the definition to your `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----

<featureManager>
    <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

----

[#mpjwt]
== Verify security tokens in a container-neutral way to simplify deployment (MicroProfile JWT 1.1)

MicroProfile JWT enables authentication and identity propagation using JWT tokens. However, the mechanism for configuring the token issuers, public keys or JWKS URLs used for token validation is container-specific when using MicroProfile JWT 1.0. MicroProfile JWT 1.1 uses MicroProfile Config 1.x to allow token issuers, public keys, and JWKS URLs to be defined at the server or in an application in a container-neutral way. This simplifies deployment and improves interoperability. MicroProfile JWT 1.1 also adds Authentication Filter support, so MicroProfile JWT authentication can be limited to a subset of application URLs. 

To enable the MicroProfile JWT 1.1 feature:

1. Add the `mpJwt-1.1` and `appSecurity-2.0` features to the `server.xml` and, optionally, define an `mpJwt` configuration if configuration beyond public keys and issuers is needed:
+
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>mpJwt-1.1</feature>
    <feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<mpJwt id="myMpJwt" ... />
----

2. Supply either the token issuer and public key or the public key retrieval path or URL that will be used to retrieve the key. These can be system properties, environment variables, or entries in a `microprofile-config.properties` file within an application. For example, add to the `microprofile-config.properties` file one of the following entries: 
+
[source,xml]
----
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/META-INF/orange.pem
----
+
or
+
[source,xml]
----
mp.jwt.verify.publickey=(pkcs#8 key goes here)
 
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://server.example.com
----
+
For UNIX and Linux platforms (which do not accept dots in environment variables), use `_`.

[#mpconfig]
== Dynamically update your microservice configuration (MicroProfile Config 1.3)

Most applications require configuration that is specific to the environment in which they run. Different environments require different configurations and it is highly desirable not to have to rebuild and repackage applications for each different case. MicroProfile Config allows you to separate configuration from microservices code so that the values required by the service can be maintained externally to the code. The configuration data can come from different locations and in different formats, for example from system properties and system environment variables. The `mpConfig-1.3` feature now allows you to easily and dynamically change your applicationâ€™s configuration by adding or modifying variables in the Liberty `server.xml` file.

In addition, Liberty builds on previous versions of MicroProfile Config with enhancements in the areas of implicit converters and the mapping of config properties to environment variables. You can use this feature with either the `cdi-1.2` feature or the `cdi-2.0` feature.

To enable the MicroProfile Config 1.3 feature, add it to the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpConfig-1.3</feature>
</featureManager>
----


For more info, see [Neil Young's TODOblog post].


[#mprestclient]
== Reactive programming in a type-safe RESTful client (MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1)

MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1 expands on the 1.0 version by providing asynchronous method support using Java 8's CompletionStage APIs. It also allows better integration with other MicroProfile technologies and third parties and adds support for URIs.

The new async method support makes reactive programming possible in a type-safe RESTful client. Prior to this feature, you would either have to sacrifice type-safety and use the JAX-RS 2.X Client APIs to get asynchronous/reactive support, or sacrifice async/reactive support for type-safety. No more!

The other improvements are minor in nature but still make life easier for developers. You no longer need to specify the `@Dependent` annotation on REST client interfaces when used with CDI. You can also use URIs, which can be constructed without throwing a `MalformedURLException`, saving a few lines of unnecessary try/catch blocks.

REST client interface methods that return a `CompletionStage` are treated as asynchronous:

[source,java]
----
...
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .executorService(executor)
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
CompletionStage<Widget> cs = client.getWidget(widgetId);
cs.thenApply(...);
...
@Path("/widget")
public interface MyClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/{widgetId}"
    CompletionStage<Widget> getWidget(@PathParam("widgetId") String widgetId);
}
----


Learn about MicroProfile Rest Client in https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client.html[Consuming RESTful services with template interfaces].


To enable the MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1 feature, add it to the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpRestClient-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>
----

For more info, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_mp_restclient.html[Configuring the MicroProfile Rest Client].




[#mptracing]
== Automatically trace JAX-RS requests between microservices (MicroProfile Open Tracing 1.1)

Distributed tracing enables users to see the flow of requests between microservices:

* See which microservices have high latency
* See hierarchy of calls between applications and their dependent microservices:
  * `opentracing-1.1` provides the Open Tracing v0.31 API
  * `mpOpenTracing-1.1` implements the MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.1 specification

Use `mpOpenTracing-1.1` in combination with `opentracingZipkin-0.31` to send traces to Zipkin. You can download Zipkin from https://github.com/WASdev/sample.opentracing.zipkintracer[Zipkin on GitHub]. When `mpOpenTracing-1.1` and `opentracingZipkin-0.31` are enabled, inbound and outbound JAX-RS requests are automatically traced. Developers can also instrument their code with `@Traced` to explicitly trace a class or a method. Traces are sent to Zipkin and users can see their traces in the Zipkin UI.


To enable MicroProfile Open Tracing 1.1, add the definition to your `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----

<featureManager>
    <feature>mpOpenTracing-1.1</feature>
    <feature>usr:opentracingZipkin-0.31</feature>
</featureManager>

----

[#mpfault]
== TODO (MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.1)

TODO

To enable MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.1, add the definition to your `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----

<featureManager>
    <feature>TODO</feature>
</featureManager>

----







[#mpmetrics]
== Access metrics without authentication (MicroProfile Metrics 1.1)

A new option for accessing `/metrics` without authentication makes it easier for developers and administrators to set up monitoring of Liberty servers in situations where security isn't required. Tools such as Prometheus or Collectd can be set up quickly to scrape metrics from Liberty.

MicroProfile Metrics in Liberty provides metrics for application developers and administrators to monitor their applications. Metrics are often collected and stored in a time series database such as Prometheus. Previously, the `/metrics` endpoint provided by Liberty required basic authentication. Administrators needed to add the username and password to Prometheus's configuration in order for Prometheus to scrape the metrics from Liberty.

An optional configuration attribute is now available to turn off the basic authentication of the `/metrics` endpoint. Prometheus can automatically discover Liberty's `/metrics` endpoint without modifying its configuration.

To turn off basic authentication for the `/metrics` endpoint, add `<mpMetrics authentication="false"/>` to `server.xml`:


[source,xml]
----

<featureManager>
    <feature>mpMetrics-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>

<mpMetrics authentication="false"/>
----


For more info:

* https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_mp_metrics_monitor.html[Monitoring with MicroProfile metrics]


[#monitor]
== Get Liberty component metrics from \metrics endpoint (Monitor 1.0)

see metrics related to Liberty components, eg. connection pools, sessions, servlets, etc., in Prometheus by using the standard HTTP scraper to get all metrics from /metrics which provided by mpMetrics-1.1.

before, they can only access Liberty component metric by JMX mbean. Through this new feature, they can simply access Liberty component metric through the mpMetrics-1.1 /metrics endpoint.

To make Monitor 1.0 metrics available at the `\metrics` endpoint:

1. https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_mp_metrics_monitor.html[Set up mpMetrics-1.1].
2. Add `monitor-1.0` to your `server.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpMetrics-1.1</feature> 
  <feature>monitor-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

[#jdbc]
== Use a java.sql.Driver as a data source (JDBC 4.2, 4.1, 4.0)

It is now possible to use JDBC drivers that only provide a java.sql.Driver and not a data source implementation as data sources in Liberty. Liberty is able to autodetect these drivers via the ServiceLoader mechanism and match the correct one based on the URL property. Based on JDBC driver autodetection, Liberty has also enhanced its logic for discovering data source implementation class names when not specified in the configuration. This makes configuration of Liberty data sources simpler and more intuitive. It also expands the range of JDBC drivers that can be used with Liberty data sources.

To enable JDBC 4.2 (jdbc-4.2), 4.1 (jdbc-4.1), or 4.0 (jdbc-4.0), add the definition to your `server.xml` along with any other features you wish to use. Then configure the data source with a URL property using the URL format defined by the JDBC vendor. For example:

[source,xml]
----

<featureManager>
    <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
    <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
    <feature>servlet-4.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<dataSource jndiName="jdbc/myDataSource" type="java.sql.Driver">
    <jdbcDriver libraryRef="myJDBCDriver"/>
    <properties url="jdbc:mydriver://host1.rchland.ibm.com:2345?databaseName=testdb"/>
    <containerAuthData user="user1" password="pwd1"/>
</dataSource>
